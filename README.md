# Regression & Time Series Analysis – YouTube Performance

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **YouTube channel performance metrics** over a 60-day period to identify trends and forecast short-term engagement. Using Python, linear regression, moving averages, and ARIMA time-series modeling, the project provides insights into views, likes, and subscriber growth while predicting future performance.

---

## Dataset
- **File:** `youtube_data_past_60days.xlsx`  
- Daily YouTube metrics for 60 days: `Views`, `Likes`, `Subscribers`  
- Data is numerical, time-indexed, and contains no missing values  
- Values like "1.3K" or "2.5M" are converted to numeric format in preprocessing  

---

## Research Questions
1. How have **Views, Likes, and Subscribers** changed over the past 60 days?  
2. Can we identify trends in these metrics using **linear regression**?  
3. Can we forecast **future Views** using **ARIMA**?  
4. What is the expected channel performance over the **next 5 days**?  

---

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning**: Converted string metrics like '1.3K' or '2.5M' to numeric values.  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Plotted historical trends of Views, Likes, and Subscribers.  
3. **Linear Regression**: Modeled metrics against Serial Number (time index) to identify trends.  
4. **Moving Average**: Applied 7-day moving average to smooth short-term fluctuations.  
5. **ARIMA Forecasting**: Built ARIMA(1,1,1) model on Views to predict the next 5 days.  

---

## Analytical Summary
- **Positive growth trend** observed across Views, Likes, and Subscribers over the 60-day period.  
- **Linear regression** confirmed upward trends in all metrics.  
- **7-day moving average** smoothed fluctuations and revealed stable engagement trends.  
- **ARIMA forecasting** predicts Views will likely stabilize over the next 5 days, supporting recent performance improvements.  

---

## Assumptions
- Past trends are representative of near-future behavior.  
- External factors like viral content or algorithm changes are not considered.  
- Metrics are accurately recorded.  
- ARIMA assumptions: weakly stationary after differencing; no major structural breaks.  

---

## Limitations
- Forecast horizon is short (5 days).  
- Forecast is only for **Views**; Likes/Subscribers are not forecasted.  
- External events can significantly affect actual metrics.  
- Small dataset (60 points) may limit model accuracy.  

---

## Implications
- Helps in planning **content strategy** based on expected trends.  
- Identifies short-term growth or decline in Views.  
- Supports better **resource allocation** (e.g., promoting videos on predicted high-view days).  
- Demonstrates practical application of data analytics in social media forecasting.
